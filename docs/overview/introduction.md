# Introduction

The **CloudLab Terraform Provider** is a custom Terraform plugin that integrates with the [CloudLab](https://www.cloudlab.us) academic testbed to automate provisioning of experiments and infrastructure.

Built as an independent engineering project at **West Chester University**, this provider brings reproducibility, CI/CD, and IaC discipline to system-level research.

### Key Capabilities

- Automate CloudLab **experiments** with declarative Terraform configs  
- Reproduce environments from version-controlled templates  
- Integrate provisioning into **CI/CD**  
- Apply industry patterns (IaC) to **open research testbeds**

### Audience

- Researchers and students using **CloudLab**  
- Educators teaching **Infrastructure-as-Code**  
- Cloud engineers exploring **bare-metal research** with access to Cloudlab
